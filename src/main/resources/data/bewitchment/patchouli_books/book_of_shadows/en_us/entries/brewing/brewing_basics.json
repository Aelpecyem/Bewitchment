Each ingredient will increase the Altar Power needed to bottle the brew by 150, and having insufficient Altar Power while brewing will cause the brew to fail immediately, so keep that in mind.$(br2)Ingredients can be divided into Potion Ingredients and Modifiers. No matter your Altar Power, you can only add up to four ingredients."
